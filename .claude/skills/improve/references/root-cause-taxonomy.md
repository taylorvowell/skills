# Root-cause taxonomy

The diagnostic core of `/improve`. For each friction point, answer the pivotal question — **why didn't Claude start in the right place?** — and classify the answer into one of these seven categories. The category drives the routing (see `routing-matrix.md`).

A single friction point can be a blend (e.g. a wrong-tool detour *caused by* a missing env fact). Tag the dominant cause, and note the secondary one — they may route to different sinks.

| # | Category | What it means | Signals in the thread |
|---|----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | **Missing environment fact** | Claude lacked a true fact about how *this* project / machine / deployment is wired. The general-world model was fine; the local reality wasn't known. | A fact the user supplied that Claude couldn't have known and that isn't written down (e.g. "the CMS runs in local Docker right now, not on the cloud host"). Claude says "oh, I didn't realize…" after a correction. |
| 2 | **Wrong default assumption** | Claude applied a plausible general-world default that is wrong *here*. The fact may even be discoverable, but Claude's prior overrode it. | Claude assumed the common case ("it's cloud-hosted → check the cloud dashboard") instead of checking. The detour follows the shape of a generic mental model, not this repo. |
| 3 | **Wrong tool / MCP / shell selection** | Claude reached for the wrong instrument — repeatedly or for several turns — when a better-fitting one existed. | Same wrong MCP invoked more than once (a database MCP for a CMS issue); PowerShell-vs-Bash thrash; using a CLI by hand where a connected MCP was the intended path; ignoring the tool routing table. |
| 4 | **Knowledge existed but didn't fire** | The fact *was* already captured — in memory, a `CLAUDE.md` section, a skill, an ADR — but it didn't surface at the moment it was needed. **This is the "why didn't it start there" case, and the most commonly missed.** | The dedupe check (SKILL step 3) finds an existing note/section/skill that covers it. The knowledge was present but buried, mis-scoped, in a skill that didn't trigger, or behind a broken `[[wikilink]]`. |
| 5 | **No procedure / flailing** | There was no playbook for a recurring multi-step situation, so Claude improvised by trial and error. | A sequence of "try X, didn't work, try Y, didn't work" with no reference to a runbook; the resolution was a *procedure* (a series of steps), not a single fact. |
| 6 | **Stale / incorrect knowledge** | Claude followed information that *used* to be true. A doc, memory, ADR, or comment is now wrong and actively misled. | The misleading source can be named (an ADR that's been superseded in practice, a memory note describing a service that moved, a comment that lies). The fix is to correct/retire the source, not add a new one. |
| 7 | **Repeated manual toil** | A multi-step manual action was done several times that a deterministic guard, script, or automation could have prevented or shortcut. | The same correction/cleanup/setup ritual recurs across this session (or is noted as recurring across sessions); a mechanical check would have caught the mistake before it cost time. |

## How to use this taxonomy

- **Push past the symptom.** "The build failed" / "the page spun" is never the category — it's the surface. Keep asking "and why didn't Claude already know to do the resolving thing?" until you land on one of the seven.
- **Category 4 changes everything downstream.** If the dedupe check finds the lesson already exists, the friction is *discoverability*, not *ignorance*. Do not write the fact again. Fix where/how it lives so it fires next time (see the routing matrix's category-4 row).
- **Categories 1 vs 2 are a useful split.** Missing-fact (1) → the fix is to *write the fact down*. Wrong-default (2) → the fix is often to write down the *correction to the default* ("don't assume cloud-hosting; in this repo, check X first"), which is a subtly different, more pointed note.
- **Categories 5 and 7 are the ones that escalate to procedures/automation.** A single fact belongs in memory or a `CLAUDE.md` line. A *series of steps* belongs in a runbook (5). A *mechanical, repeatable guard* belongs in a hook or script (7).
